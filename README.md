# Bachelor Thesis

This respository is created for the thesis of Romana Wilschut for the bachelor ‘Artificial Intelligence’ at the University of Amsterdam. We implemented the *smart voting* model of Colley et al., created data for this model and count the number of delegation cycles. 

# Usage
To use the model, we run `main.py`. 

This file creates valid smart profiles according to the parameters. You can change these parameters and also the path to where these files are stored. Then, the final collective outcome of each created valid smart profile is calculated for each of the different unravelling procedures, and also how many cycles occurred during the unravelling of a profile.
