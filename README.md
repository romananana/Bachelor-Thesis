# Bachelor Thesis

This respository is created for the thesis of Romana Wilschut for the bachelor ‘Artificial Intelligence’ at the University of Amsterdam. We implemented the *smart voting* model of Colley et al., created data for this model and count the number of delegation cycles.

# Usage

## Create data
To create smart ballots for the model, we run `create_data.py`. 
In this file, you can state the wanted parameters of the smart ballot and the amount of ballots.

## Outcome and cycles
The outcome of a smart ballot and the number of delegation cycles in this ballot can be found by running `main.py`.
In this file, you need to specify of which smart ballots you want the results.
